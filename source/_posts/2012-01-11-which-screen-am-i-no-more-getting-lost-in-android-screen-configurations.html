title: Which Screen Am I? No more getting lost in Android screen configurations

<p>Are you as puzzled as me when it comes to Android screen classification? According to the official docs, Android puts device screens into buckets, based on two properties: screen size, and pixel density. However, the lines are blurry, it's often not clear which exact values are used to put a device in one bucket or the next.</p>
<p>If you keep pondering the screen class of your device(s), ponder no more. I've built a little app that helps developers decide in which of these buckets your device falls. It's called <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.github.kaeppler.whichscreen">Which Screen Am I?</a> and it's <a href="https://github.com/kaeppler/WhichScreenAmI">free and open source</a>. This is how it looks on a FroYo emulator that uses the HVGA skin and a medium pixel density:</p>

<p>If you're targeting different screen configurations with different APKs, this takes at least some of the pain out of the testing process.</p>
