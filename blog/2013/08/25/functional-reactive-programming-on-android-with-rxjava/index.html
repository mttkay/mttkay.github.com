	<div class="entry-content"><p>Shameless plug: if after reading this article, you want to know more, come hear me talk at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/lineup/">DroidCon UK 2013</a>!</p>

<p>If you are an application developer, there are two inconvenient truths:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modern applications are inherently concurrent.</li>
<li>Writing concurrent programs that are correct is difficult.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the domain of mobile or desktop applications,
parallel execution allows for responsive user interfaces because we can move
computations into the background while the UI responds to ongoing
user interactions. Code must execute concurrently
to not stray from this fundamental requirement.
Writing such programs
is diffcult because on mobile they are typically written in imperative
languages like C or Java. Writing concurrent code in imperative
languages is difficult because code is written in terms of interweaved,
temporal instructions that move objects
or data structures from one state to another. This imperative style of programming
inherently produces side effects. It presents several problems when running
instructions in parallel, such as race conditions when writing to a shared resource.</p>

<h1>Resistance is futile&#8211;or is it?</h1>

<p>Developers have grown accustomed to the drawbacks of
expressing concurrency in imperative languages.
On platforms like Android where Java is (still) the
dominant language, concurrency simply sucks, and we should just give in and deal with it.
I personally keep a close eye on the server side end of the spectrum.
Over the past few years,
functional programming has made an astounding comeback
in terms of rate of adoption and innovation, the details of which
I will not get into here. In the case of concurrency, functional programming has
a very simple answer to dealing with shared state: don&#8217;t have it.</p>

<h2>Problems of concurrent programming with AsyncTask</h2>

<p>Being based on Java, Android comes with a standard number of Java concurrency
primitives such as <code>Thread</code>s and <code>Future</code>s. While these tools make
it easy to perform simple asynchronous tasks, they are fairly low level and require
a substantial amount of diligence when you use them to model complex
interactions between concurrent objects. A frequent use case on Android
or any UI-driven application is to perform a background job
and then update the UI with the result of the operation. Android provides <code>AsyncTask</code>
for exactly that:</p>

<p>This looks straightforward. Define a method <code>doInBackground</code> that accepts
something through its formal parameters, and returns something as the result
of the operation. Android guarantees that this code will execute in a thread
that is not the main user-interface thread. We also define a UI callback function
<code>onPostExecute</code> that receives the result of the computation and can consume
it on the main UI thread, since Android guarantees that this method will always
be invoked on the main thread.</p>

<h3>In search for the jigsaw-puzzle pieces</h3>

<p>So far so good. What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?
Let&#8217;s start with <code>doInBackground</code>, which
downloads a file&#8211;a costly operation because it involves network and disk I/O.
There are many things that can go wrong, so we want to
recover from errors, and add a try-catch block. What do we do in the catch
block? Log the error? Perhaps we want to inform
the user about this error too, which likely involves interacting with the UI.
Wait, we cannot do that because we are not allowed to update any user-interface elements
from a background thread. Bummer.</p>

<p>It should be easy to handle that error in <code>onPostExecute</code>.
We might reason that it is as simple as holding on to the exception in a private
field (i.e. we write it on the background thread), and check in <code>onPostExecute</code>
(i.e. read it on the UI thread) if that field is set to something other than
null (did I mention we love null checks) and display it to the user in some way
shape or form. But wait, how do we obtain a reference to a
<code>Context</code>, without which we cannot do anything meaningful with the UI? Apparently,
we have to bind it to the task instance up front, at the point of instantiation,
and keep a reference to it throughout a task&#8217;s execution. But what if the download
takes a minute to run? Do we want to hold on to an <code>Activity</code> instance
for an entire minute? What if the user decides to back out of the Activity that
triggered the task, and we are holding on to a stale reference. This not only
creates a substantial memory leak, but is also worthless because meanwhile it
has been detached from the application window. A problem that
<a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=asynctask+configuration+change">everyone is well aware of</a>.</p>

<h3>Beyond the basics</h3>

<p>There are other problems
with all this. The preceding task is incredibly simple. Picture a more complicated
scenario where we need to orchestrate a number of such operations. For example, we might
want to fetch some JSON from a service API, parse it, map it,
filter it, cache it to disk, and only then feed the result to the UI. All
the aforementioned operations should&#8211;as per the single responsibility principle&#8211;exist
as separate objects, perhaps exposed through different services. It is difficult and
non-intuitive to use <code>AsyncTask</code> because it requires
grouping any number of combinations of service interactions into separate task
classes. This results in a proliferation of meaningless task classes,
from the perspective of your business logic.</p>

<p>Another option is to have one task class per service-object invocation, or
wrap the service objects themselves in <code>AsyncTasks</code>.
Composing service objects means nesting <code>AsyncTask</code>, which leads to what is
commonly referred to as &#8220;callback hell&#8221; because you start tasks from a task callback
from a task callback from a &#8230; you get the idea.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <code>AsyncTask</code>s scheduling behavior varies significantly across
different versions of Android. It&#8217;s changed from a capped thread pool
in the 1.x days (with varying bounds depending on the API level)
to a <em>single thread executor</em> model in 4.x. Read that again. Your tasks (plural)
do <em>not</em> run concurrently to each other on ICS devices and beyond (although they do run
concurrently to the main UI thread). Why did Google decide to serialize task execution?
Developers could not get it right,
applications suffered from nasty problems due to race conditions and incorrectly
synchronized code.</p>

<h3>The inconvenient truth</h3>

<p>Should we still use <code>Thread</code> and <code>AsyncTask</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is &#8220;probably&#8221;. For simple, one-shot jobs that do not require
much orchestration, <code>AsyncTask</code> is fine. For anything more complex
it is doable, but requires juggling with <code>volatile</code>s, <code>WeakReference</code>s,
<code>null</code> checks, and other <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/06/05/confident-ruby-beta/">defensive, unconfident mechanisms</a>.
Perhaps worst of all, it requires you to
think about things that have nothing to do with the problem that you set out to solve, which is<br/>
to download a file.</p>

<h1>Enter RxJava&#8211;now with more Android</h1>

<p>To come back to the initial problem statement, do we have to give in to the lack
of high-level abstractions and deal with it, or do better solutions exist? Turns
out that functional programming might have an answer to
this. &#8220;But wait&#8221; you might say, &#8220;I still wanna use Java?&#8221;. Turns out, yes, you can.
It is not super pretty (at least not unless Google whips out its magic wand and
gives us Java 8 and closures on Dalvik, or unless you feel attracted to anonymous classes and
six levels of identation). However, it solves all of the problems in
one fell swoop:</p>

<ul>
<li>No standard mechanism to recover from errors</li>
<li>Lack of control over thread scheduling (unless you like to dig deep)</li>
<li>No obvious way to compose asynchronous operations</li>
<li>No obvious and hassle-free way of attaching to <code>Context</code></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava">RxJava</a> is an implementation of the Reactive Extensions (Rx)
on the JVM, courtesy of Netflix. Rx was first conceived by Erik Meijer
on the Microsoft .NET platform, as a way of combining data or event streams with
reactive objects and functional composition. In Rx, events are modeled
as observable streams to which observers are subscribed. These streams, or observables
for short, can be filtered, transformed, and composed in various ways before their
results are emitted to an observer. Every observer is defined within three messages:
<code>onNext</code>, <code>onCompleted</code>, and <code>onError</code>. Concurrency is a variable in this equation,
and abstracted away in the form of schedulers. Generally, every observable stream
exposes an interface that is modeled after concurrent execution flows (i.e. you don&#8217;t
call it, you subscribe to it), but by default is executed synchronously. Introducing
schedulers can make an observable execute using various concurrency primitives
such as threads, thread pools, or even Scala actors. Here is an example:</p>

<p>This creates a new, observable stream from the given list of integers, and emits
them one after another on the given observer. The use of <code>subscribeOn</code> and <code>observeOn</code>
configures the stream to emit the numbers on a new <code>Thread</code>, and to receive them on
the Android main UI thread. For example, the observer&#8217;s <code>onNext</code> method is called on the main thread.
Eventually, you unsubscribe from the observable. Here is an example <code>Observer</code> implementation:</p>

<p>The preceding example creates a method that builds an <code>Observable</code> <em>stream</em>, which in this case
only ever emits a single item (the file) to which a <code>File</code> observer can connect. Whenever
this observable is subscribed to, its <code>onSubscribe</code> function triggers and executes the task at hand.
If the task can be carried out successfully, deliver the result to the observer through <code>onNext</code>
so <code>onNext</code> can properly react to it. Then signal completion by using <code>onCompleted</code>. If an exception
is raised, deliver it to the observer through <code>onError</code>. As an example, you can use this from a <code>Fragment</code>:</p>

<p>By using RxJava, the aforementioned issues are solved all at the same time. The <code>fromFragment</code>
call transforms the given source observable in such a way that events will only be emitted to the
fragment if it&#8217;s still alive and attached to its host activity. Call <code>unsubscribe</code> in <code>onDestroy</code> to ensure
that all references to the fragment, which is also the observer, are released.</p>

<p>You can have proper error handling through an observer&#8217;s <code>onError</code> callback. Also, you can
execute the task on any given scheduler with a simple method call. Doing so gives you fine-grained
control over where the expensive code is run and where the callbacks will run, all without
you having to write a single line of synchronization logic. Futhermore, RxJava allows you to
compose and transform observables to obtain new ones, which enables you to reuse code easily.
For example, to not emit the <code>File</code> itself, but merely its path, transform the <em>existing</em> observable:</p>

<p>You can see how powerful this way of expressing asynchronous computations is.
At <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, we are moving most of our code that relies
heavily on event-based and asynchronous operations to Rx observables. For
convenience, we contributed <code>AndroidSchedulers</code> that schedule an observer to receive callbacks
on a <code>Handler</code> thread. See <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/tree/master/rxjava-contrib/rxjava-android">rxjava-android</a>.
We are also in the process of contributing those operators back that allow observing
observables from Fragments and Activities in an easy and safe way, as seen in the previous example.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, RxJava finally makes concurrency and event-based programming on Android hassle free.
Note that we follow the same strategy on iOS using GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">Reactive Cocoa</a>
library because we have committed ourselves to the functional-reactive paradigm.
We think that it is an exciting development that leads to code that is more stable, easier to unit test,
and free of low-level state or concurrency concerns that would otherwise take over your
service objects.</p>

<p>To hear more about this topic, watch this <a href="http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2013/08/responsive-android-applications-with-sane-code/">interview with our Director of Mobile Engineering on Root Access Berlin</a>
and come see me at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/lineup/">DroidCon UK 2013</a> where I will be speaking about RxJava and its use in the SoundCloud application on the developer track.</p>
