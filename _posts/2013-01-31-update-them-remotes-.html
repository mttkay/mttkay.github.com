title: Update Them Remotes!
published: true

<p>In an act of malevolence, I decided to update my Twitter and GitHub to use the same username. This means that repository URLs have changed and everything can now be found under:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mttkay">https://github.com/mttkay</a></p>
<p>So update those remotes! Here's how:</p>
<p>$ git remote set-url &lt;remote&gt; &lt;new_url&gt;</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion.</p>
