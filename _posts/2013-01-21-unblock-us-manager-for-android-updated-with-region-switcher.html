title: Unblock Us Manager for Android Updated With Region Switcher
published: true
---
<p>I have pushed out an update to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.unblockus.manager">Unblock Us Manager</a> on the Google Play store which adds the content region switcher a few users, including myself, were asking for. I've added a few small UI improvements along the way.</p>
<p>Drop me a line if you find the app is not working well for you.</p>
