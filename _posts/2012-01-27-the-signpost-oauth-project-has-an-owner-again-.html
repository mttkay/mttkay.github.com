title: The Signpost OAuth project has an owner again!
published: true
---
<p>In 2009, I <a href="http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/introducing-signpost-easy-oauth-for-java-and-apache-httpcomponents-android-too/">introduced Signpost</a>, a lightweight, client-side OAuth library for Java. I initially created it to power the API connector in our <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.qype.radar">Qype Android app</a>, and kept maintaining it for a year or two, until I <a href="http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/stepping-back-from-signpost-development/">got bored with fixing random issues</a> with random OAuth service providers that I honestly didn't care about whatsoever. In its latest release, the library still works flawlessly for us, so I had little motivation to continue work on it.</p>
<p>However, I understand that it probably doesn't work flawlessly for everyone, so with me backing away from developing it further, a project maintainer was obviously needed. It looks like we've finally found someone who's willing to enter the painful world of OAuth 1.0! Meet <a href="http://blog.polysfactory.com/">Takahiro Horikawa</a>, who will take full ownership of the project from here on, managing issues, releases, and the project website.</p>
