			Functional Reactive Programming on Android With RxJava</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you&#8217;re an app developer, there are two facts about your daily life that
can only be described as an inconvenient truth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modern applications are inherently concurrent.</li>
<li>Writing concurrent programs (that are correct) is hard.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are good reasons for both of these points. In the domain of mobile or desktop applications,
parallel execution allows for responsive user interfaces, since we can move
computations into the background while leaving the UI responding to ongoing
user interaction. We have to deal with the fact that code must execute concurrently
in order to not break with this fundamental requirement.
Moreover, writing such programs
is hard, since at least on mobile, they are typically written in imperative
languages like C or Java. The reason why writing concurrent code in imperative
languages is hard is because code is written in terms of interweaved
temporal instructions that move objects
or data structures from one state to another. This imperative style of programming
is inherently bound to producing side effects, and gives rises to a number of problems when running these
instructions in parallel, such as race conditions when writing to a shared resource.</p>

<h1>Resistance is futile&#8211;or is it?</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s almost awkward how accustomed developers have grown to the drawbacks of
expressing concurrency using imperative languages. I have myself taken it for a
fact, an inconvenient truth: on platforms like Android where Java is (still) the
dominant language, concurrency simply sucks, and we should just give in and deal with it.
I personally keep a close eye on what&#8217;s happening on the other end of the spectrum
though, i.e. the server side, and it so happens that over the past few years,
functional programming has made an astounding comeback. I mean astounding as in
incredible in terms of rate of adoption and innovation. This has many reasons which
I won&#8217;t get into here, but in the case of concurrency, functional programming has
a very simple answer to dealing with shared state: don&#8217;t have it.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a quick look at the status quo of concurrency in Android, and what
the problems are.</p>

<h2>Problems of concurrent programming with AsyncTask</h2>

<p>Being based on Java, Android comes with your standard share of Java concurrency
primitives, such as <code>Thread</code>s and <code>Future</code>s. Needless to say, these tools, while making
it easy to perform simple asynchronous tasks, are fairly low level and require
a substantial amount of diligence when used to model complex
interactions between concurrent objects. One very frequent use case on Android
(and any UI driven application for that matter) is to perform a background job
and then update the UI with the result of the operation. Android gives us <code>AsyncTask</code>
for exactly that, and it&#8217;s used somewhat like this:</p>

<p>This looks straight forward. We define a method <code>doInBackground</code> which accepts
something through its formal parameters, and returns something as the result
of the operation. Android guarantees us that this code will execute in a thread
that&#8217;s not the main user interface thread. We also define a UI callback called
<code>onPostExecute</code>, which receives the result of the computation and can consume
it on the main UI thread, since Android guarantees that this method will always
be invoked on the main thread. So far so good. What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?</p>

<h3>In search for those jigsaw pieces</h3>

<p>Quite a few things as it turns out. Let&#8217;s start with <code>doInBackground</code>. As you
can see we download a file here, a costly operation since it involves network and disk I/O.
There&#8217;s about a hundred things that can go wrong here, so we surely want to
recover from errors, and add a try-catch block. Just what do we do in the catch
block? Log the error? That&#8217;s good and fine, but perhaps we may want to inform
the user about this error too, which likely involves interacting with the UI, but
wait, we can&#8217;t do that sine we&#8217;re not allowed to update user interface elements
from a background thread. Bummer.</p>

<p>Surely it should be easy to handle that error in <code>onPostExecute</code> then.
We might reason that it&#8217;s as simple as holding on to the exception in a private
field (i.e. we write it on the background thread), and check in <code>onPostExecute</code>
(i.e. read it on the UI thread) if that field is set to something other than
null (did I mention we love null checks) and display it to the user in some way
shape or form. (The observant reader at this point notes that text in parens
equals: subtle problems ahead.) But wait, how do we obtain a reference to a
<code>Context</code>, without which we cannot do anything meaningful with the UI? Apparently
we have to bind it to the task instance up front, at the point of instantiation,
and keep a reference to it throughout the task execution. But what if the download
takes a minute to run? Do we want to hold on to e.g. an <code>Activity</code> instance
for an entire minute? What if the user decides to back out of the Activity which
triggered the task, and we&#8217;re now holding on to a stale reference, which not only
creates a substantial memory leak, but also isn&#8217;t worth a dime, since it
has meanwhile been detached from the application window? A problem that, as <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=asynctask+configuration+change">a
simple Google search suggests</a>, everyone is well aware of.</p>

<h3>Beyond the basics</h3>

<p>Without wanting to beat horses that are already dead, there are other problems
with all this. The task above is incredibly simple. Picture more complicated
scenarios where we need to orchestrate a number of such operations. We might
for instance want to fetch some JSON from a service API, parse it, map it,
filter it, cache it to disk, and only then feed the result to the UI. All
the operations just mentioned should&#8211;as per the single responsibility principle&#8211;exist
as separate objects, perhaps exposed through different services. Composing
these using <code>AsyncTask</code> is difficult and non-intuitive, since it requires
grouping any number of combinations of service interactions into separate task
classes, resulting in a proliferation of&#8211;from the perspective of your business
logic&#8211;meaningless task classes.</p>

<p>Another option would be to have one task class per service object invocation, or
have the service objects themselves wrap their code in <code>AsyncTasks</code>. This then
means that composing service objects means nesting <code>AsyncTask</code>, leading to what&#8217;s
commonly called the &#8220;callback hell&#8221;, since you start tasks from a task callback
from a task callback from&#8230; you get the idea.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, <code>AsyncTask</code>s scheduling behavior varies significantly across
different versions of Android. I believe I have seen it changing from a capped
thread pool back in the 1.x days (with varying bounds depending again on the API level)
to a <em>single thread executor</em> model in 4.x. Read that again: your tasks (plural)
do <em>not</em> run concurrently to each other on ICS devices and beyond (although they do run
concurrently to the main UI thread). Why did GOOG decide to serialize task execution?
For the same reason I&#8217;m writing this post. Developers simply couldn&#8217;t get it right,
applications suffered from nasty problems due to race conditions and incorrectly
synchronized code.</p>

<h3>The inconvenient truth</h3>

<p>So, should we still use <code>Thread</code> and <code>AsyncTask</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is: probably. For very simple, one-shot jobs that do not require
much orchestration, <code>AsyncTask</code> is fine. For anything beyond that:
it&#8217;s doable, but it requires juggling with <code>volatile</code>s, <code>WeakReference</code>s,
<code>null</code> checks, and other <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/06/05/confident-ruby-beta/">defensive, unconfident mechanisms</a>,
but perhaps worst of all, it requires us to
think about things that have nothing to do with the problem we set out to solve:
downloading a file.</p>

<h1>Enter RxJava&#8211;now with more Android</h1>

<p>To come back to the initial problem statement: do we have to give in to the lack
of high level abstractions and deal with it, or are there better solutions? Turns
out that as initially hinted at, functional programming might have an answer to
this. &#8220;But wait&#8221; you might say, &#8220;I still want to use Java?&#8221;. Turns out: yes we can.
It&#8217;s not super pretty (at least not unless Google whip out their magic wand and
give us Java 8 and closures on Dalvik, or unless you feel attracted to anonymous classes and
six levels of identation), but it happens to solve all of the above problems in
one fell swoop. To summarize again what these problems were:</p>

<ul>
<li>No standard mechanism to recover from errors</li>
<li>Lack of control over thread scheduling (unless you like to dig deep)</li>
<li>No obvious way to compose asynchronous operations</li>
<li>No obvious and hassle free way of attaching to <code>Context</code></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava">RxJava</a> is an implementation of the Reactive Extensions (Rx)
on the JVM, courtesy of Netflix. Rx was first conceived by Erik Meijer
on the Microsoft .NET platform, as a way of combining data or event streams with
reactive objects and functional composition. In Rx, events are modeled
as observable streams, to which observers are subscribed. These streams, or observables
for short, can be filtered, transformed and composed in various ways before their
results are emitted to an observer. Every observer is defined over three simple messages:
<code>onNext</code>, <code>onCompleted</code>, and <code>onError</code>. Concurrency is a variable in this equation,
and abstracted away in the form of schedulers. Generally, every observable stream
exposes an interface that is modeled around concurrent execution flows (i.e. you don&#8217;t
call it, you subscribe to it), but by default is executed synchronously. Introducing
schedulers can then make an observable execute using various concurrency primitives
such as threads, thread pools, or even Scala actors. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This creates a new observable stream from the given list of integers, and emits
them one after another on the given observer. The use of <code>subscribeOn</code> and <code>observeOn</code>
configures the stream to emit the numbers on a new <code>Thread</code>, and receive them on
the Android main UI thread (i.e. the observer&#8217;s <code>onNext</code> method is called on the main thread.)
Eventually, we also unsubscribe from the observable.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a possible <code>Observer</code> implementation:</p>

<p>Now this is not a very interesting example. Let&#8217;s have a look at how we might implement
the download task as an Rx <code>Observable</code>.</p>

<p>What we do here is create a method which builds an <code>Observable</code> &#8220;stream&#8221; (in our case emitting
only ever a single item, the file), to which a <code>File</code> observer can connect. Whenever
this observable is subscribed to, its <code>call</code> function will trigger and execute the task at hand.
If the task can be carried out successfully, we deliver the result to the observer through <code>onNext</code>,
so it can properly react to it. We then signal completion through <code>onCompleted</code>. If an exception
is raised, we deliver it to the observer through <code>onError</code>. Here is how you use this
from, say, a <code>Fragment</code>:</p>

<p>As you can see, with RxJava the aforementioned issues have been solved in one fell swoop.
We can have proper error handling through an observer&#8217;s <code>onError</code> callback. We can
execute the task on any given scheduler with a simple method call, and have fine grained
control over where the expensive code is run and where the callbacks will run, without
the need to write a single line of synchronization logic. RxJava also allows us to
compose and transform observables to obtain new ones, thus enabling easy reuse of code.
For instance, in order to not emit the <code>File</code> itself, but merely its path, we can take
the <em>existing</em> observable and transform it:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It should be easy to see how powerful this way of expressing asynchronous computations is.
At <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a> we are currently in the process of moving most of our code that relies
heavily on event based and asynchronous operations to Rx observables. For everyone&#8217;s
convenience, for RxJava 0.10.1 we have contributed <code>AndroidSchedulers</code> which schedule an observer to receive callbacks
on a <code>Handler</code> thread (see <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/tree/master/rxjava-contrib/rxjava-android">rxjava-android</a>). We also plan to open source more
components that we currently use, but that are still being refined. For instance, we use
a custom <code>Observer</code> which makes guarantees that callbacks to fragments only happen
whenever the fragment is attached and the Activity is alive, thus making your own code
more reliable.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, RxJava finally makes concurrency and event based programming on Android hassle free.
It should be noted that we follow the same strategy on iOS using GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">Reactive Cocoa</a>
library, since as a team we have committed ourselves to the functional reactive paradigm.
We think it&#8217;s an exciting development that leads to more stable code that is easy to unit test,
and free of low level state or concurrency concerns that would otherwise take over your
service objects.</p>

			Herding HTTP Requests, or Why Your Keep-Alive Connection May Already Be Dead</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the more expensive things you can do on Android, or mobile in general, is
sending and receiving data over a mobile network connection. Holding a dedicated channel
in particular causes high battery consumption,
as much as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Resource_Control#cite_ref-energyconsumption_2-0">a hundred times more compared to being idle</a>. Moreover, there is overhead
on various levels when establishing a dedicated connection: First, <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2010/08/23/android-tutorial-reducing-power-consumption-of-connected-apps/">it has has been shown</a>
that poor timing w.r.t. sending network requests can leave the connection in states
with high power consumption before going back to idle, even when it&#8217;s not actively
used. Second, establishing an HTTP connection, especially when using secure sockets (HTTPS),
will result in a handshake being performed between the mobile client and the server,
even when multiple requests are sent in quick succession. If no proper precaution
is taken, these handshakes will occur N times when N requests are being sent, and your app
will incur the associated extra cost of network traffic and battery consumption.</p>

<p>To mitigate these issues, it is generally advisable to batch HTTP requests whenever
possible and send them over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">persistent HTTP connection</a>.
This can be implemented using request queues (persisted or in memory)
which are emptied at a given time using HTTP Keep-Alive. At SoundCloud we have recently
implemented a tracking component which batches up a number of requests and flushes it
in certain intervals to minimize the aforementioned overhead. However, we stumbled
a few times when trying to make persistent connections work with HttpURLConnection, so make
sure to double check your own implementation against the next few paragraphs or
you may unwittingly send a large number of requests over separate connections,
even when Keep-Alive is enabled. So let me break it to you:</p>

<h1>HTTP Keep-Alive on Android does NOT just work</h1>

<p>Fortunately for us, Android sets the Keep-Alive header by default, which a quick glance
at the header fields of a newly opened HttpURLConnection shows. However, we were
surprised to see that Android would still happily open new connections when
using code like the snippet below:</p>

<p>Sniffing these requests with Wireshark showed that they were sent using separate
TCP streams coming from different client ports (indicating separate connections.)
Looking at the code, we&#8217;re not closing the connection until we&#8217;ve sent the last
request, and we made sure Keep-Alive is actually set for every request, so what&#8217;s the problem here?</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/keep_alive_not_working.png"></p>

<h1>Finding the culprit</h1>

<p>Revisiting <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/http-keepalive.html">Persistent Connections</a>
we found this curious paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the application finishes reading the response body or when the application calls close() on the InputStream returned by URLConnection.getInputStream(), the JDK&#8217;s HTTP protocol handler will try to clean up the connection and if successful, put the connection into a connection cache for reuse by future HTTP requests.</p></blockquote>


<p>Apparently, in order to actually being able to reuse a connection, the implementation must
know where one HTTP request on the same TCP connection ends and the next one starts.
In our case, we weren&#8217;t interested in the response payload since these were fire-and-forget
style requests, so we simply added a</p>

<p><code>connection.getInputStream().close();</code></p>

<p>as the documentation suggests. This, still, did not work for us. Again Android would not reuse
TCP sockets but open a new one for every request; we haven&#8217;t found out why this is happening
so please leave me a comment if you do. From here on you&#8217;re left with two options:
You either fully consume the response payload, which you may want to do anyway depending
on your mileage. This would mean reading bytes from the input stream until hitting the EOS byte.
Alternatively, if you&#8217;re not interested in the server&#8217;s response, you should do as
the document above suggests and send an HTTP HEAD instead:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that in this case, neither closing the input stream nor consuming it is required
since there will be no response payload to read from.
Returning to Wireshark, here&#8217;s what the communication with the server looks like now:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/tcp_stream_keep_alive.png"></p>

<p>This is what we wanted to begin with: Client and server establish a TCP stream, then sending all
six GET requests over the same connection. After doing our work, either the client or the
server will terminate the connection by starting a FIN exchange. Here it is important to
understand that calling <code>connection.disconnent()</code> does not guarantee triggering FIN.
From the documentation of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html">HttpURLConnection</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once the response body has been read, the HttpURLConnection should be closed by calling disconnect(). <br/>Disconnecting releases the resources held by a connection so they may be closed or reused.</p></blockquote>


<p>The emphasis here is on <em>may</em>: as you can see from the previous screenshot, it was the server
that decided to terminate the connection at some point, and not our call to <code>disconnect</code>,
since the first FIN is sent by the destination not the source.</p>

	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Being sloppy when it comes to managing your application&#8217;s resource IDs can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to find and debug. Imagine a scenario where foo_activity.xml holds the layout definition for FooActivity, and you define three different variants for different screen configurations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">res/layout/foo_activity.xml<br />res/layout-land/foo_activity.xml<br />res/layout-sw600dp/foo_activity.xml</p>
<p>Now, with some certainty these three layouts will share the same views, with the same IDs, just slightly differently styled or arranged. Let&#8217;s furthermore assume in all three layouts, we have a TextView:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682037.js"></script></p>
<p>FooActivity will of course retrieve a reference to this TextView via findViewById:</p>

<p>Now what happens if in the main layout file (layout/foo_activity) you change the view&#8217;s ID? You may be surprised to hear that your application will still compile. That&#8217;s because the old view ID, my_text, still exists in R.java, since while now gone from layout/foo_activity.xml, it&#8217;s still (re)created using the @+id notation in the other two layouts, thus continuing to exist in the ID pool. Whenever these layouts are loaded and you reference the new ID from FooActivity, then of course your application will crash.</p>
<p>The problem here stems from violating the DRY principle: we&#8217;re carelessly repeating the code which creates a resource ID, when ideally, it should only ever be found in one, and only one part of the application. To recall what @+id does, it&#8217;s an idempotent &#8220;create this ID&#8221; action. In other words, if that ID has not been defined yet, it will get defined, otherwise it will be used. So it&#8217;s safe to use this notation multiple times with the same ID, which may be the reason why people overuse it: it looks like a safe bet, when it&#8217;s actually not.</p>
<p>There are three approaches I have tried to deal with this issue:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">1 - Pulling view IDs into styles</span></strong></p>
<p>When redefining views multiple times in different layouts, one approach could be to extract the respective view IDs into a style, then apply the single shared style to all three variants of the view:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682862.js"></script></p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4683025.js"></script></p>
<p>While I first favored this, there are several problems with this approach: first, it reduces the visibility of IDs, which can be confusing when dealing with views in RelativeLayout, where you reference views using IDs. Moreover, IntelliJ IDEA at least will get terribly confused and issue an error, since it doesn&#8217;t resolve styles to inspect the correctness of a layout file (it&#8217;ll assume the view is missing the ID attribute.) Lastly, and this is purely a style question, one could argue that styles should be concerned with only visual appearance, not structural attributes like IDs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">2 - Pulling view IDs into ids.xml</span></strong></p>
<p>Another option is to pull the shared view IDs into a global resource file, e.g. in res/ids.xml:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682090.js"></script></p>
<p>This will turn the respective view IDs into first class resources themselves, and by extension make them reachable via R.id and in all layout files. Here, too, no @+-notation is required in any layout files anymore. You would define shared IDs in one, and only one location.</p>
<p>The problems with this approach are similar to 1, but it clears up with the stylistic problem of defining IDs in a style sheet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">3 - How We Do It (TM)</span></strong></p>
<p>We ended up taking a third route, which is one of convention. We&#8217;ve agreed on establishing a rule which says that it&#8217;s fine to use @+id in layouts files, but only use it in the default layout file, i.e. the one located in res/layout. Whenever a layout is overloaded using different configuations, then even for the same views, @id should be used. That way we ensure that there is only a single location where an ID actually gets defined, without taking it completely out of context when working with layout XML. Moreover, changing the view&#8217;s ID will lead to compilation errors, since all overloaded variants now reference a non-existing ID.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to hear how everyone else deals with this.&nbsp;</p>

			Unblock-Us Manager Now Available on Google Play</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m a big proponent of <a href="http://www.unblock-us.com/">Unblock Us</a>, a VPN-less solution for using online service that are not available in your country, such as Netflix, Hulu, Pandora etc., in your country. It&#8217;s purely based on DNS, which means it works on all network connected devices and has practically zero performance impacts.</p>
<p>One thing that always bugged was that one has to reactivate their IP address with Unblock Us whenever it changes, e.g. after rebooting your WiFi router. Previously one had to go to unblock-us.com, wait for the service checker widget to detect that you had a new IP address, and manually reactivate it by clicking a pop-up link. On Google TV this was particularly annoying, since the browsing experience isn&#8217;t exactly great and it was just uncomfortable, since you didn&#8217;t even realize until e.g. Netflix would stop working.</p>
<p>Long story short, I&#8217;ve written an Android application which does all that for you, automatically. It sits idle on your Android device and will be woken up by the system whenever your network connectivity changes. It will then automatically register with unblock-us.com with the current IP address. This should ensure a seamless viewing / listening experience for Unblock Us supported services.</p>
<p>The app is tiny, requires merely internet access permissions, and doesn&#8217;t even require a password&#8211;just your email address you used to sign up with Unblock Us. Your email address will be used to send an activation request to unblock-us.com.</p>
<p>Ideas for new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a region chooser similar to the one on the website</li>
<li>Provide a service monitor that will notify you about outages of Netflix and other services</li>
</ul>

			Why the Google TV SDK Lacks an In-app Live TV Widget</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have been following Google TV for a while now, and right after its announcement I was pretty excited, pondering the vast amount of opportunities for creating Android apps that would enrich your TV viewing experience.</p>
<p>That said I was pretty dumbstruck to learn that a PIP (picture-in-picture) component, i.e. an Android view displaying the live TV stream to be embedded in your applications, does not exist (or more precisely: is not available for you to use.) In other words, the most obvious and powerful use case for an Android based TV platform, namely building Android applications around a live TV signal, is not possible to realize. Quoting from the documentation [1]:</p>
<p class="note" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 6px 8px 6px 10px; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 6px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #999999; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efefef;"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The picture-in-picture (PIP) feature of the Live TV app is not available to other Android applications. Also, you can&#8217;t run an Android application in the small PIP window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As puzzling as Google&#8217;s decision to not provide such a component may sound at first, there is actually a very simple explanation for it. After last week&#8217;s DevFest event in Berlin, I had a chance to speak to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/108026429364238951323">Matt Gaunt</a>, developer advocate for Google TV in London, about this very issue. Apparently, the lack of a PIP component has purely legal reasons. Think about it: if any Android application would be able to overlay its content over a TV channel, that channel&#8217;s content could easily be compromised and the viewer tricked into believing that the overlaid content is actually part of the show. While this would not be an issue with &#8220;trusted&#8221; services such as, say, a content overlay containing background information for a news show, malicious apps could easily exploit this to misrepresent or otherwise distort the content aired by the TV channel.</p>
<p>Hence, to make this happen, Google would have to ask every single TV channel in the world for permission&nbsp;to allow content being overlaid by third party apps. You can easily see how unlikely this will ever be to happen, since Fox News is probably not interested in apps waving an Obama flag in front of their channel logo, to name one example.</p>
<p>For now, unfortunately, Google TV remains a mere TV-or-apps experience, not both.</p>

			Android&#8217;s New Build System: Good Times Guaranteed.</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As of now, most of you probably heard that Google is abandoning Ant and is moving to a <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system">new, modern build system</a> based on the excellent Gradle build system. I have been a big fan of Gradle for some time now, and tried promoting and working on its Android features in my spare time (as part of <a href="https://github.com/jvoegele/gradle-android-plugin">gradle-android-plugin</a>), so this comes as fantastic news to me.</p>
<p>One thing I was worried about is that with a big change like this, the de facto standard for building, packaging and distributing Android library projects as created and promoted by the great guys behind <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/">android-maven-plugin</a>, i.e. the apklib artifact kind, would now become obsolete shortly after it had turned out so successful. Keep in mind that all work on Maven related features was and is entirely community driven, and not directly supported by Google.</p>
<p>However, android-maven-plugin&#8217;s Manfred Moser just <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!topic/maven-android-developers/lQCMRKInuyk">clarified on the developer mailing list</a> that in fact they had been working together with both Xavier Ducrohet (the Google SDK tools lead) and Hans Dockter (founder of Gradle and Gradleware&#8217;s CEO) to streamline their efforts. Here&#8217;s what will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmatic access to SDK tools functionality will be provided by an open-source library built and maintained by Google, and will be available on Maven Central</li>
<li>The former apklib artifact type will be improved upon and renamed to .aar (Android Archive), in the spirit of Java&#8217;s JAR and WAR types</li>
</ul>
<p>The Maven Android plugin will start supporting this new format in the forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>Now what does all this mean for developers? It means mostly two things: First, with Google&#8217;s move to Gradle, there will be an excellent build system available out of the box with all the neat features Gradle provides, such as exposing a nice DSL using the Groovy programming language, dependency management via Ivy, plugin support, etc. pp. Second, no one using Maven now to build their Android apps will have to make the switch: android-maven-plugin will continue to work and co-exist, and even better, it will be a symbiotic co-existence between the two systems.</p>
<p>If you want to get a 5 minute head start into Gradle for Android, have a look at my slide deck <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/matthiaskaeppler/hands-on-the-gradle">&#8220;Hands on the Gradle&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Good times guaranteed!</p>

			Testing Whether an Application Is Installed on the SD Card</a>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Here&#8217;s a little code snippet that can be very useful whenever you have to deal with broadcast intents: it checks whether an application is installed on SD card. The reason why this is useful in combination with broadcast receivers is that apps installed to external storage will simply not receive all broadcasts (for instance, BOOT_COMPLETED cannot be received by apps on SD.)</p>
