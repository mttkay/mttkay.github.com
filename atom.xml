    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is part 2 of <a href="http://mttkay.github.io/blog/2014/01/25/your-app-as-a-function/">Monads: Your App As A Function</a>.</p>

<p>In the previous post we started looking at monads, and summarized that their core
purpose is to transport values or computations along a call chain.
(Functional programming is all about <a href="http://blog.maybeapps.com/post/42894317939/input-and-output">inputs and outputs.</a>)
To enable this behavior, we said monads have the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monads are types with two functions <code>unit</code> and <code>flatMap</code></li>
<li>Monads are constructed via unit to contain arbitrary data</li>
<li>Monads are chained together (potentially transforming the contained data) via flatMap</li>
</ul>


<p>We concluded the article by saying that this is not the entire truth. What we
have neglected so far are the laws that govern unit and flatMap, and that have
to hold true for a type that looks like a monad, to actually <em>be</em> a monad.</p>

<p>Let me begin by saying that there is no deeper meaning in these laws beyond
supporting common sense. I still think it&#8217;s worth looking at them because they
close the loop to imperative programming, which you might be more familiar with,
since especially the second and third laws enable what&#8217;s been attributed to monads
as being &#8220;programmable semicolons&#8221; in case you&#8217;ve stumbled upon that phrase before.</p>

<h1>The three monad laws</h1>

<p>As I mentioned, it&#8217;s not actually sufficient to merely provide the unit and flatMap
functions in order to write a monad type. These two functions must also behave in a certain way.
This behavior is summarized in three short algebraic laws, and they are as
follows.</p>

<h3>Associativity</h3>

<p>The law of associativity says exactly what you&#8217;d expect it to. It demands that
for any monad <code>m</code> and any two functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>,
it must not make a difference whether you apply f to m first and then apply g to
the result, or if you first apply g to the result of f (recall that functions
passed to flatMap return monads) and then in turn flatMap this over m. Or
in short:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(m flatMap f) flatMap g == m flatMap ((x) -> f(x) flatMap g)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What does that mean or why is it important? It simply means that the order in which
you compose individual steps must not affect the overall outcome. This doesn&#8217;t
have any deeper meaning beyond not violating common sense: if you pour yourself
a coffee, it shouldn&#8217;t make any difference whether you first pour the coffee,
then add sugar and cream, or first mix sugar and cream and add coffee to it.
(I deliberately chose coffee, not tea, since any true Englishmen would disagree
with this statement!) To clear up with a common misunderstanding: the law of
associativity says nothing about the order of <em>execution</em>; only about the order
of <em>composition</em>. Since the computation defined by <code>f</code> often involves side effects,
the order of execution obviously <em>does</em> matter (writing a file to disk and then
formatting the hard drive has a different outcome than formatting the hard drive
and then writing files to it!)</p>

<h3>Left and right identity</h3>

<p>Now these two are more interesting. <strong>The left unit law (&#8220;left identity&#8221;)</strong> states that:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unit(x) flatMap f == f(x)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or in prose: flatMap must behave in such a way that for any function <code>f</code> passed to it,
the result is the same as calling <code>f</code> in isolation. This might be a bit
more difficult to grasp at first, but beyond the aspect of chainability that
we&#8217;ve already discovered, this law enables <strong>the &#8220;3rd C&#8221;: confinement.</strong></p>

<p>Essentially it says: flatMap allows you to peek at the value contained
in the monad and apply a transformation to it, all without leaving the monad.
This is also why monads are called &#8220;programmable semicolons&#8221;: they allow you
to &#8220;lift&#8221; an imperative statement into the confinement of the monad using a
higher order function (flatMap) and chain it to the next computation, rather than
separating the two computations by calling them explicitly and placing a
semicolon between them (The &#8220;semicolon&#8221; here is not meant to be understood literally,
but as a metaphor for demarcating expressions in an imperative call style.
Even in languages that do not use semicolons, this applies.)
That is, given two monad types <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code>, instead of saying:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>m1 = M1.unit(x);
</span><span class='line'>m2 = f(m1.get()); // f returns an instance of M2
</span><span class='line'>result = m2.get();
</span><span class='line'>...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can say:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>result = M2.unit(x).flatMap(f).get();</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>That is, we have obtained the result without explicitly peeking at <code>x</code> simply
by replacing imperative calls with a more fluent functional call style. An important
take away here is: this leaves no room for further side effects in flatMap.
Since the outcome must be equivalent as per this law, flatMap must not &#8220;squeeze&#8221;
any extra side effects between the &#8220;semicolons&#8221;.</p>

<p>That leaves only <strong>the right unit law (&#8220;right identity&#8221;)</strong>. Let&#8217;s have a look at its formal
definition:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>m flatMap unit == m</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or in plain English, applying the unit constructor to a monad has the exact same outcome
as not calling it at all. Again this makes perfect sense if you translate it to
an imperative programming style. Instead of saying:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>result = m.get();</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You can say:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>result = m.flatMap(Monad.unit).get();</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>How does that make sense? It turns out that this law is important to support
a fluent call style, since it allows us to build up long monad call chains
without worrying that a function passed to flatMap might represent the value
we&#8217;ve already obtained. This becomes more obvious if in the code snippet above
you replace the call to <code>Monad.unit</code> with some arbitrary <code>f</code>, which <em>might</em> return
the unit constructor. Again, this law states that there is no room for side
effects here. For a nice example of why this law is important, I suggest having
a look at Scala&#8217;s <code>Option[T]</code> monad, or Guava&#8217;s <code>Optional&lt;T&gt;</code> if you prefer Java.</p>

<h1>Now that you know the laws, forget about them</h1>

<p>You saw this coming, right? I honestly think that the monad laws mostly exist
to prevent behavior that would be counter-intuitive.
In fact, there is at least one very good case where the left unit law should be
violated: exception handling. To recall, the law states that:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>unit(x) flatMap f == f(x)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But what if <code>f</code> throws an exception? If <code>flatMap</code> is supposed to behave the
same way as the right hand side, then it will, too, throw an exception and
terminate the call chain. That&#8217;s bad, since it destroys one of the most valuable
aspects of monads: chaining computations together. In defense of the purists,
in mathematics, there is no such thing as exceptions. Signals don&#8217;t magically
stop functions and make them return nothing. Unfortunately, in the real world
we&#8217;re faced with functions that are not pure in a mathematical sense, so instead
we take the &#8220;third C&#8221;, confinement, a little further and transform the exception to a value
and trap it in the monad. This is exactly what RxJava does when trapping an
exception and re-routing it to <a href="http://netflix.github.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observer.html#onError(java.lang.Throwable)">Observer#onError</a>, or
the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/nightly/docs/library/index.html#scala.util.Try">Try</a> type in Scala. So while their type structure is monadic, they actually
violate the left identity law and hence are not true monads. But who cares as
long as they get the job done!</p>

<p>Speaking about getting the job done: we&#8217;re now able to rewrite that piece of
code we kicked things off with in the first article, and transform it to
a fluent code style using RxJava&#8217;s monad(-ish) <a href="http://netflix.github.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html">Observable</a> type.</p>

<h1>Tying up the ends</h1>

<p>Now that you understand what monads are and why they&#8217;re useful, let&#8217;s put the
knowledge to practice and revisit our initial code snippet.
Here it is again for your convenience:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">FetchJsonObject</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">AsyncTask</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Void</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">JsonObject</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">];</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">json</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">serviceApi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">readString</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">cache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">persist</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">json</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">JsonObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">parse</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Remember how I said that we can think of each line of code here as a step in a
series of transformations, and that the monad helps us transport the results
from one step to the next.
We also said that each step may terminate the entire task by throwing an exception.
Just to emphasize: this is bad. It means the entire task is not really deterministic,
and what we&#8217;re missing are well-defined &#8220;exit points&#8221;, that allow us to terminate
the sequence gracefully. It all reminds us of a really fragile soap bubble,
where on each line we risk the bubble to burst, without having a good exit strategy.</p>

<p>We can rewrite this using a monadic type now, in this case an RxJava <code>Observable</code>,
which lets us turn the soap bubble into
something less fragile:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;...&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">serviceApi</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">doOnNext</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">cache</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">persist</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">json</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">flatMap</span><span class="o">((</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">from</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">JsonObject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">parse</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">subscribe</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">JsonObjectObserver</span><span class="o">());</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;ve used Java 8 closure syntax here to keep the example concise and clear.
Note how we transformed our semicolons into a monadic call chain. <code>serviceApi.get</code>
does not immediately return a value anymore; instead, it returns an <code>Observable&lt;String&gt;</code>
holding the API call result. We then want to perform a side effect by caching
this result, which we do using another monad transformation called <code>doOnNext</code>,
an action that&#8217;s performed for every value emitted.
We then transform the fetch result into another monad, namely from <code>Observable&lt;String&gt;</code>
to <code>Observable&lt;JsonObject&gt;</code> by passing a function to <code>flatMap</code> that parses
the JSON String and sticks it in a new monad/observable. We finally subscribe
a listener that receives the final result.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a few key things here that make this implementation superior to what we
started out with, and I suggest to compare these against our initial Q&amp;A we
went through in the previous article:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>RxJava ensures that if in any of the above steps an exception is thrown, it
will be propagated to the observer and subsequent steps will be skipped. In other words,
we don&#8217;t have to worry about errors until we actually <em>need</em> to deal with them.</p></li>
<li><p>You can gracefully terminate the call chain yourself by calling <code>onCompleted</code>
on the given observer. This allows you to skip any subsequent steps in case
there is nothing meaningful to return, i.e. there&#8217;s no need to return <code>null</code>
anywhere. The observer will simply receive nothing through <code>onNext</code> and complete
straight away.</p></li>
<li><p>In RxJava, scheduling an individual step to run on another thread than the
one you started on, is treated as just another transformation of the call chain.
This means you can use a monad transformation to specify concurrency,
making it a simple and natural aspect to deal with.</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, all of the above applies to <em>all</em> possible steps in the
call chain, freeing you from the burden of making decisions for every single
step in your sequence.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Instead of a soap bubble, we have an assembly line now, where results of
individual steps are transported in a resilient and well defined way. Exit
points are clear and dealt with uniformly, regardless of where we leave the
monad&#8211;even in the case of error.</p>

    <link href="http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2014/01/25/your-app-as-a-function/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-25T09:15:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2014/01/25/your-app-as-a-function</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A paper by Twitter&#8217;s Marius Eriksen (<a href="http://monkey.org/~marius/funsrv.pdf">&#8220;Your server as a function&#8221;</a>), which introduces
the key concepts behind Finagle is what made me choose the title for this post.
I believe functional programming (FP) will be just as important to mobile
application development in the future as it is for web development today.
Since I first jumped the &#8220;reactive bandwagon&#8221; about a year ago, other companies
like Parse/Facebook and Spotify have started to move to functional programming
on mobile to simplify concurrent programming (via the <a href="https://github.com/BoltsFramework">BoltsFramework</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/trickle">trickle</a> library respectively.)</p>

<p>The
reason is quite simple: it&#8217;s easier to write resilient code in functional languages,
and resilience is key. Performance might be a feature, but resilience is a
<em>must</em>. If the critical paths through your business logic are brittle, then your
app can be as fast as light, but your users will still scoff at it and look
elsewhere for value or entertainment.</p>

<p>I write Android applications, and Java is not a functional language. It&#8217;s not
even an object-oriented language, at least not in a puristic sense. However,
that doesn&#8217;t stop us from adopting some of the good practices found in FP to
improve on existing Java code. In this post I&#8217;ll try to explain how adopting
one of the most fundamental type patterns in FP, monadic types, can dramatically
simplify and improve the robustness of your core application logic.</p>

<p>I have already written about <a href="http://mttkay.github.io/blog/2013/08/25/functional-reactive-programming-on-android-with-rxjava/">RxJava and functional reactive programming</a> and how
we make use of it in our mobile applications at SoundCloud.<br/>
I hope it served as a good introduction
into using that library specifically, and how expressing expensive operations
through Observables makes your code more resilient to failure and easier to
compose.</p>

<p>However, there&#8217;s a reason why Observables are so
universally useful: they&#8217;re monads. This post is my own attempt at explaining
monads, why they&#8217;re so valuable, and why you should consider using them.</p>

<p>Before you keep reading&#8211;or, heavens forbid, consider dropping out here!&#8211;let me say that none
of the following pragraphs will assume you have experience with FP or any functional
language for that matter. I will use Java for all examples, so that you have
something familiar to work with if you&#8217;re a Java (or Android) developer already.</p>

<h1>Say Monad one more time&#8230;</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s almost a joke these days. People hate it when FP folks start talking about
monads. People hate it, because they have a vague idea at best of what a monad
is, and it makes you feel like an idiot. No one wants to be an idiot! Let me
tell you: you&#8217;re not an idiot, and monads are not difficult to understand. It&#8217;s
just surprisingly difficult to explain them.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a mathematician. I don&#8217;t know category theory. But I believe I have
understood monads to a degree that I can make effective use of them in the code
I write day in and day out, and that I can even write my own monadic types.
Here&#8217;s another piece of good news: if you understand monads, you understand most
of the underpinnings of functional languages. You&#8217;ll quickly find when jumping
from one FPL to the next, monads will follow you around. It&#8217;s a bit like
understanding classes in object-oriented languages. If all you&#8217;ve ever known is
procedures and value types, then classes may seem odd at first. But once you
understand classes, it doesn&#8217;t matter which OOPL you use, the concepts remain
the same.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a monad? I think monads are best explained (and appreciated!) by
realizing in what poor situation you as an imperative programmer actually are.
So I&#8217;ll start by showing you a piece of code that I bet you&#8217;ve written
yourself in some way shape or form at some point in time,
and then making you reflect on why your code sucks. No offense by the way, my code sucks too.
But that&#8217;s the great thing about being a developer,
right? We strive to make code suck a little less every single day.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at the example.</p>

<h1>A piece of code you&#8217;ve written before</h1>

<p>If you&#8217;re an app developer, chances are you connect to some service API to
download JSON or XML that describes your business objects. At SoundCloud,
everything evolves around tracks, so we download track metadata a lot. If
you&#8217;re doing it right, then you&#8217;re also caching this data somewhere. It doesn&#8217;t
really matter where or how, it could be in a database or just using flat files.
Here&#8217;s a very typical of way of doing this in Android using the AsyncTask class:</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry too much about what types JsonObject or serviceApi are here. This is just pseudo
code serving to get my point across. It should still be easy to see that we&#8217;re trying
to achieve the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download a JSON document from a given URL</li>
<li>Cache it to disk using the URL as the cache key</li>
<li>Parse it into an in-memory representation</li>
</ol>


<p>Instead of actually pointing out what the problem with all this is, let&#8217;s turn
this into a short Q&amp;A. Have a look at the following questions. What are <em>your</em> answers
to each of them?</p>

<h4>Q: Every single line here can throw an exception. Where is it handled?</h4>

<p>A: Simple, you wrap everything in a try/catch block. Fair enough. Then what?
How do you propagate the exception to the caller? Recall that this job is running
on a background thread, so there might be visibility issues. Moreover, how do
you signal the error? You have to return something from <code>doInBackground</code>. Thinking
about returning null? You might want to listen to what <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Tony Hoare has to say about
null references</a> (he invented them by the way.)</p>

<h4>Q: If the API request fails, what do we return?</h4>

<p>A: Easy, we return null! Sorry, but <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare">Tony Hoare says NO</a>, so let&#8217;s put our
foot down on that one okay?</p>

<h4>Q: If the API request succeeds but caching fails, do we throw out the result?</h4>

<p>A: Uhm, maybe? We haven&#8217;t really thought about how to propagate the data in this
series of steps. Aha! There&#8217;s our first clue about what a monad is: transporting
data as a series of steps. I&#8217;ll pick this up again later.</p>

<h4>Q: Should caching to local storage happen on the same thread as sending API requests?</h4>

<p>A: Probably not. Because this could mean that API requests block local storage
I/O from happening in case they take longer than expected, right? It almost looks
as if caching to local storage should happen in its own task. Or maybe it
has something to do with propagating data as a series of steps&#8230; (This is where
you should picture me waving a flag in your face that says monad on it.)</p>

<h4>Q: If I want to just make an API request/just cache to local storage, do I write a new AsyncTask for each?</h4>

<p>A: I suppose so. If we did that, however, how would we combine them to arrive
at the definition above, which performs both steps in succession and pipes data
from one task to the next? I smell sulfur, we might be well on our way to <a href="http://ianbishop.github.io/blog/2013/01/13/escape-from-callback-hell/">callback hell</a>.</p>

<p>I hope the picture begins taking shape. It appears there are a number of related
problems here, most of them having to do with <em>processing data as a series of
potentially asynchronous steps where failure in each step is anticipated.</em></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s finally look at what monads are and how they solve this for us.</p>

<h1>Monads explained</h1>

<p>We&#8217;ll get a little more concrete now and jump straight into the definition of
what monads are and what has to hold true for a monad to actually be a monad.
I then show how a simple monadic type could look like in Java.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s first look at some of the existing definitions that attempt to put
monads in a single sentence. Erik Meijer, the man behind the <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com/">Reactive Extensions</a>
and my personal hero for wearing a SoundCloud t-shirt on stage at GOTO Berlin,
has this to say about monads:</p>

<blockquote><p>Monads are return types that guide you through the happy path.</p></blockquote>

<p>This might be my favorite definition, because it catches the gist of what monads are
all about. However, it&#8217;s still a bit vague and doesn&#8217;t really help in understanding
what the structure of a monad is. Martin Odersky, EPFL fame and inventor of the
Scala programming language looks at it this way:</p>

<blockquote><p>Monads are parametric types with two operations flatMap and unit that obey some algebraic laws.</p></blockquote>

<p>So this is rather the opposite: this definition doesn&#8217;t really tell us what monads
are good for, but it contains some important clues about their structure, i.e. they
are types, parameterized over another type, and they consist of just two operations.
I told you monads were simple!</p>

<p>Both these definitions I took almost verbatim from the reactive programming course
on Coursera, which I highly recommend. Let&#8217;s have a look at what Wikipedia has to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>Monads are structures that represent computations defined as sequences of steps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds familiar? I told you I&#8217;d come back to the whole sequence of steps thing.
Finally, here&#8217;s my own attempt at putting monads in a sentence, and it&#8217;s the definition
I will use throughout the rest of this article:</p>

<blockquote><p>Monads are chainable container types that trap values or computations and allow them to be transformed in confinement.</p></blockquote>

<p>The key take away from this definition are the &#8220;three Cs&#8221;:
<strong>containment, chainability, and confinement.</strong></p>

<p>I will now explain how monads enable these properties for arbitrary data or
computations and why that&#8217;s super awesome.</p>

<h2>Monads are types</h2>

<p>We just learned that monads are parametric types that define just two operations, <code>unit</code>
(also called return) and <code>flatMap</code> (also called bind or mapMany). I will
show you shortly what these methods do and what a full definition of a monad
looks like in Java, but just to put your worries to rest a little: if you&#8217;ve used
Scala or RxJava before, then you&#8217;ve already seen and used
monads. All lists in Scala are monads with the <code>List</code> constructor method as
unit and a flatMap method to transform them. Observables in RxJava are monads
with <code>Observable.from</code> as unit and mapMany to transform them
(mapMany in RxJava is actually aliased to flatMap, so you can use either one.)</p>

<p>That said, let&#8217;s have a look at the structure of a monadic type in Java:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I&#8217;ve added a third method here, <code>get</code>, but it&#8217;s hardly worth talking about a
getter function, so let&#8217;s skip it as part of the discussion and turn straight
to <code>unit</code> and <code>flatMap</code>.</p>

<h2>The 1st C: unit enables containment</h2>

<p>There&#8217;s an obvious take away from the snippet above: a monad is defined over a type <code>T</code> which
it contains values of. Containment here is enabled by the <code>unit</code> function: it takes a <code>T</code>
and traps it in the monad by creating a new instance of the monad with that value
passed into it. At this point I should mention that <code>T</code> can be anything, including
collection types like lists. Remember RxJava and observables? An Observable is
a monad defined over collections of values. Let&#8217;s keep things simple though
and let&#8217;s create a monad of integers:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="n">Monad</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">intMonad</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Monad</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So we stuff the number 2 in our monad. Cool, but not so useful thus far.
What makes it useful is the flatMap method, so let&#8217;s turn to flatMap.</p>

<h2>The 2nd C: flatMap enables chainability</h2>

<p>I admit this one might look a bit more puzzling, but it&#8217;s
actually pretty straight forward once you look past the awkward syntax. The <code>flatMap</code>
function itself is defined over a new type variable, <code>R</code>, and it returns a new monad
of that type <code>Monad&lt;R&gt;</code>. It does so, however, not just by trapping the value in it like
unit does, but by applying a function to the current value, a function which
knows how to turn <code>T</code>s into monads of <code>R</code>. (I borrowed the <code>Func1</code> type from
RxJava here: it means it&#8217;s a function object that takes 1 argument of type <code>T</code>
and returns something of type <code>Monad&lt;R&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>Let this sink in for a second, since this is perhaps the most important aspect
of monads. It&#8217;s important because it allows us to chain monads together using
transformations of the values they contain. I can take a monad containing, say,
an integer, and flatMap it using a function which takes this integer, transforms
it (say, by taking the square root of that number) and sticking it in a new monad. The last part
is critical, since it means we can do this forever and ever, because the return
value will be a monad again with a flatMap function which can again take a
function which returns another monad which has&#8230; you get the idea.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take the square root example using the monad we just created:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">intMonad</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">flatMap</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">Func1</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Monad</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Double</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Monad</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Double</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">call</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Integer</span> <span class="n">input</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Monad</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">unit</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">sqrt</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">));</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}).</span><span class="na">get</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now that looks more useful! What we&#8217;ve done here is take our initial integer
monad and transformed it using flatMap to obtain a new monad of type <code>Monad&lt;Double&gt;</code>
that contains the square root of the initial value. This is fundamentally
different from applying the <code>sqrt</code> function directly to some input, since
there&#8217;s no flatMap method defined on <code>double</code> that you could use to apply
further transformations, so you&#8217;d effectivly lose the property of chainability.</p>

<p>This also enables entirely new perspectives in terms of code structure and reuse:
since the monad structure never changes, your business logic is
entirely expressed in terms of functions, which transform values step wise,
are defined and tested in isolation, and composed together to form new
pieces of functionality. It&#8217;s like Legos, but using functions.</p>

<h2>The 3rd C: To be continued&#8230;</h2>

<p>If you paid attention at the beginning, you might have noticed that the &#8220;3rd C&#8221;, namely
confinement is still missing. This is because is has to do
with the algebraic laws a monad has to obey. Frankly, I haven&#8217;t been completely honest with you.
Types with <code>unit</code> and <code>flatMap</code> follow a monadic structure, but purists will say they&#8217;re not
actually monads unless they obey some algebraic laws.</p>

<p>What the three monad laws are, what implications they have, and how we
can piece everything together to turn our initial <code>AsyncTask</code> example into
something fundamentally better using monads is what I will cover in part 2 of this article.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shameless plug: if after reading this article, you want to know more, come hear me talk at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/lineup/">DroidCon UK 2013</a>!</p>

<p>If you are an application developer, there are two inconvenient truths:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modern applications are inherently concurrent.</li>
<li>Writing concurrent programs that are correct is difficult.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the domain of mobile or desktop applications,
parallel execution allows for responsive user interfaces because we can move
computations into the background while the UI responds to ongoing
user interactions. Code must execute concurrently
to not stray from this fundamental requirement.
Writing such programs
is diffcult because on mobile they are typically written in imperative
languages like C or Java. Writing concurrent code in imperative
languages is difficult because code is written in terms of interweaved,
temporal instructions that move objects
or data structures from one state to another. This imperative style of programming
inherently produces side effects. It presents several problems when running
instructions in parallel, such as race conditions when writing to a shared resource.</p>

<h1>Resistance is futile&#8211;or is it?</h1>

<p>Developers have grown accustomed to the drawbacks of
expressing concurrency in imperative languages.
On platforms like Android where Java is (still) the
dominant language, concurrency simply sucks, and we should just give in and deal with it.
I personally keep a close eye on the server side end of the spectrum.
Over the past few years,
functional programming has made an astounding comeback
in terms of rate of adoption and innovation, the details of which
I will not get into here. In the case of concurrency, functional programming has
a very simple answer to dealing with shared state: don&#8217;t have it.</p>

<h2>Problems of concurrent programming with AsyncTask</h2>

<p>Being based on Java, Android comes with a standard number of Java concurrency
primitives such as <code>Thread</code>s and <code>Future</code>s. While these tools make
it easy to perform simple asynchronous tasks, they are fairly low level and require
a substantial amount of diligence when you use them to model complex
interactions between concurrent objects. A frequent use case on Android
or any UI-driven application is to perform a background job
and then update the UI with the result of the operation. Android provides <code>AsyncTask</code>
for exactly that:</p>

<p>This looks straightforward. Define a method <code>doInBackground</code> that accepts
something through its formal parameters, and returns something as the result
of the operation. Android guarantees that this code will execute in a thread
that is not the main user-interface thread. We also define a UI callback function
<code>onPostExecute</code> that receives the result of the computation and can consume
it on the main UI thread, since Android guarantees that this method will always
be invoked on the main thread.</p>

<h3>In search for the jigsaw-puzzle pieces</h3>

<p>So far so good. What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?
Let&#8217;s start with <code>doInBackground</code>, which
downloads a file&#8211;a costly operation because it involves network and disk I/O.
There are many things that can go wrong, so we want to
recover from errors, and add a try-catch block. What do we do in the catch
block? Log the error? Perhaps we want to inform
the user about this error too, which likely involves interacting with the UI.
Wait, we cannot do that because we are not allowed to update any user-interface elements
from a background thread. Bummer.</p>

<p>It should be easy to handle that error in <code>onPostExecute</code>.
We might reason that it is as simple as holding on to the exception in a private
field (i.e. we write it on the background thread), and check in <code>onPostExecute</code>
(i.e. read it on the UI thread) if that field is set to something other than
null (did I mention we love null checks) and display it to the user in some way
shape or form. But wait, how do we obtain a reference to a
<code>Context</code>, without which we cannot do anything meaningful with the UI? Apparently,
we have to bind it to the task instance up front, at the point of instantiation,
and keep a reference to it throughout a task&#8217;s execution. But what if the download
takes a minute to run? Do we want to hold on to an <code>Activity</code> instance
for an entire minute? What if the user decides to back out of the Activity that
triggered the task, and we are holding on to a stale reference. This not only
creates a substantial memory leak, but is also worthless because meanwhile it
has been detached from the application window. A problem that
<a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=asynctask+configuration+change">everyone is well aware of</a>.</p>

<h3>Beyond the basics</h3>

<p>There are other problems
with all this. The preceding task is incredibly simple. Picture a more complicated
scenario where we need to orchestrate a number of such operations. For example, we might
want to fetch some JSON from a service API, parse it, map it,
filter it, cache it to disk, and only then feed the result to the UI. All
the aforementioned operations should&#8211;as per the single responsibility principle&#8211;exist
as separate objects, perhaps exposed through different services. It is difficult and
non-intuitive to use <code>AsyncTask</code> because it requires
grouping any number of combinations of service interactions into separate task
classes. This results in a proliferation of meaningless task classes,
from the perspective of your business logic.</p>

<p>Another option is to have one task class per service-object invocation, or
wrap the service objects themselves in <code>AsyncTasks</code>.
Composing service objects means nesting <code>AsyncTask</code>, which leads to what is
commonly referred to as &#8220;callback hell&#8221; because you start tasks from a task callback
from a task callback from a &#8230; you get the idea.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <code>AsyncTask</code>s scheduling behavior varies significantly across
different versions of Android. It&#8217;s changed from a capped thread pool
in the 1.x days (with varying bounds depending on the API level)
to a <em>single thread executor</em> model in 4.x. Read that again. Your tasks (plural)
do <em>not</em> run concurrently to each other on ICS devices and beyond (although they do run
concurrently to the main UI thread). Why did Google decide to serialize task execution?
Developers could not get it right,
applications suffered from nasty problems due to race conditions and incorrectly
synchronized code.</p>

<h3>The inconvenient truth</h3>

<p>Should we still use <code>Thread</code> and <code>AsyncTask</code>?</p>

<p>The answer is &#8220;probably&#8221;. For simple, one-shot jobs that do not require
much orchestration, <code>AsyncTask</code> is fine. For anything more complex
it is doable, but requires juggling with <code>volatile</code>s, <code>WeakReference</code>s,
<code>null</code> checks, and other <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2012/06/05/confident-ruby-beta/">defensive, unconfident mechanisms</a>.
Perhaps worst of all, it requires you to
think about things that have nothing to do with the problem that you set out to solve, which is<br/>
to download a file.</p>

<h1>Enter RxJava&#8211;now with more Android</h1>

<p>To come back to the initial problem statement, do we have to give in to the lack
of high-level abstractions and deal with it, or do better solutions exist? Turns
out that functional programming might have an answer to
this. &#8220;But wait&#8221; you might say, &#8220;I still wanna use Java?&#8221;. Turns out, yes, you can.
It is not super pretty (at least not unless Google whips out its magic wand and
gives us Java 8 and closures on Dalvik, or unless you feel attracted to anonymous classes and
six levels of identation). However, it solves all of the problems in
one fell swoop:</p>

<ul>
<li>No standard mechanism to recover from errors</li>
<li>Lack of control over thread scheduling (unless you like to dig deep)</li>
<li>No obvious way to compose asynchronous operations</li>
<li>No obvious and hassle-free way of attaching to <code>Context</code></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava">RxJava</a> is an implementation of the Reactive Extensions (Rx)
on the JVM, courtesy of Netflix. Rx was first conceived by Erik Meijer
on the Microsoft .NET platform, as a way of combining data or event streams with
reactive objects and functional composition. In Rx, events are modeled
as observable streams to which observers are subscribed. These streams, or observables
for short, can be filtered, transformed, and composed in various ways before their
results are emitted to an observer. Every observer is defined within three messages:
<code>onNext</code>, <code>onCompleted</code>, and <code>onError</code>. Concurrency is a variable in this equation,
and abstracted away in the form of schedulers. Generally, every observable stream
exposes an interface that is modeled after concurrent execution flows (i.e. you don&#8217;t
call it, you subscribe to it), but by default is executed synchronously. Introducing
schedulers can make an observable execute using various concurrency primitives
such as threads, thread pools, or even Scala actors. Here is an example:</p>

<p>This creates a new, observable stream from the given list of integers, and emits
them one after another on the given observer. The use of <code>subscribeOn</code> and <code>observeOn</code>
configures the stream to emit the numbers on a new <code>Thread</code>, and to receive them on
the Android main UI thread. For example, the observer&#8217;s <code>onNext</code> method is called on the main thread.
Eventually, you unsubscribe from the observable. Here is an example <code>Observer</code> implementation:</p>

<p>The preceding example creates a method that builds an <code>Observable</code> <em>stream</em>, which in this case
only ever emits a single item (the file) to which a <code>File</code> observer can connect. Whenever
this observable is subscribed to, its <code>onSubscribe</code> function triggers and executes the task at hand.
If the task can be carried out successfully, deliver the result to the observer through <code>onNext</code>
so <code>onNext</code> can properly react to it. Then signal completion by using <code>onCompleted</code>. If an exception
is raised, deliver it to the observer through <code>onError</code>. As an example, you can use this from a <code>Fragment</code>:</p>

<p>By using RxJava, the aforementioned issues are solved all at the same time. The <code>fromFragment</code>
call transforms the given source observable in such a way that events will only be emitted to the
fragment if it&#8217;s still alive and attached to its host activity. Call <code>unsubscribe</code> in <code>onDestroy</code> to ensure
that all references to the fragment, which is also the observer, are released.</p>

<p>You can have proper error handling through an observer&#8217;s <code>onError</code> callback. Also, you can
execute the task on any given scheduler with a simple method call. Doing so gives you fine-grained
control over where the expensive code is run and where the callbacks will run, all without
you having to write a single line of synchronization logic. Futhermore, RxJava allows you to
compose and transform observables to obtain new ones, which enables you to reuse code easily.
For example, to not emit the <code>File</code> itself, but merely its path, transform the <em>existing</em> observable:</p>

<p>You can see how powerful this way of expressing asynchronous computations is.
At <a href="https://soundcloud.com">SoundCloud</a>, we are moving most of our code that relies
heavily on event-based and asynchronous operations to Rx observables. For
convenience, we contributed <code>AndroidSchedulers</code> that schedule an observer to receive callbacks
on a <code>Handler</code> thread. See <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/tree/master/rxjava-contrib/rxjava-android">rxjava-android</a>.
We are also in the process of contributing those operators back that allow observing
observables from Fragments and Activities in an easy and safe way, as seen in the previous example.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, RxJava finally makes concurrency and event-based programming on Android hassle free.
Note that we follow the same strategy on iOS using GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa">Reactive Cocoa</a>
library because we have committed ourselves to the functional-reactive paradigm.
We think that it is an exciting development that leads to code that is more stable, easier to unit test,
and free of low-level state or concurrency concerns that would otherwise take over your
service objects.</p>

<p>To hear more about this topic, watch this <a href="http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2013/08/responsive-android-applications-with-sane-code/">interview with our Director of Mobile Engineering on Root Access Berlin</a>
and come see me at <a href="http://uk.droidcon.com/2013/lineup/">DroidCon UK 2013</a> where I will be speaking about RxJava and its use in the SoundCloud application on the developer track.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the more expensive things you can do on Android, or mobile in general, is
sending and receiving data over a mobile network connection. Holding a dedicated channel
in particular causes high battery consumption,
as much as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Resource_Control#cite_ref-energyconsumption_2-0">a hundred times more compared to being idle</a>. Moreover, there is overhead
on various levels when establishing a dedicated connection: First, <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2010/08/23/android-tutorial-reducing-power-consumption-of-connected-apps/">it has has been shown</a>
that poor timing w.r.t. sending network requests can leave the connection in states
with high power consumption before going back to idle, even when it&#8217;s not actively
used. Second, establishing an HTTP connection, especially when using secure sockets (HTTPS),
will result in a handshake being performed between the mobile client and the server,
even when multiple requests are sent in quick succession. If no proper precaution
is taken, these handshakes will occur N times when N requests are being sent, and your app
will incur the associated extra cost of network traffic and battery consumption.</p>

<p>To mitigate these issues, it is generally advisable to batch HTTP requests whenever
possible and send them over a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection">persistent HTTP connection</a>.
This can be implemented using request queues (persisted or in memory)
which are emptied at a given time using HTTP Keep-Alive. At SoundCloud we have recently
implemented a tracking component which batches up a number of requests and flushes it
in certain intervals to minimize the aforementioned overhead. However, we stumbled
a few times when trying to make persistent connections work with HttpURLConnection, so make
sure to double check your own implementation against the next few paragraphs or
you may unwittingly send a large number of requests over separate connections,
even when Keep-Alive is enabled. So let me break it to you:</p>

<h1>HTTP Keep-Alive on Android does NOT just work</h1>

<p>Fortunately for us, Android sets the Keep-Alive header by default, which a quick glance
at the header fields of a newly opened HttpURLConnection shows. However, we were
surprised to see that Android would still happily open new connections when
using code like the snippet below:</p>

<p>Sniffing these requests with Wireshark showed that they were sent using separate
TCP streams coming from different client ports (indicating separate connections.)
Looking at the code, we&#8217;re not closing the connection until we&#8217;ve sent the last
request, and we made sure Keep-Alive is actually set for every request, so what&#8217;s the problem here?</p>

<p><img src="http://mttkay.github.com/images/posts/keep_alive_not_working.png"></p>

<h1>Finding the culprit</h1>

<p>Revisiting <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/http-keepalive.html">Persistent Connections</a>
we found this curious paragraph:</p>

<blockquote><p>When the application finishes reading the response body or when the application calls close() on the InputStream returned by URLConnection.getInputStream(), the JDK&#8217;s HTTP protocol handler will try to clean up the connection and if successful, put the connection into a connection cache for reuse by future HTTP requests.</p></blockquote>


<p>Apparently, in order to actually being able to reuse a connection, the implementation must
know where one HTTP request on the same TCP connection ends and the next one starts.
In our case, we weren&#8217;t interested in the response payload since these were fire-and-forget
style requests, so we simply added a</p>

<p><code>connection.getInputStream().close();</code></p>

<p>as the documentation suggests. This, still, did not work for us. Again Android would not reuse
TCP sockets but open a new one for every request; we haven&#8217;t found out why this is happening
so please leave me a comment if you do. From here on you&#8217;re left with two options:
You either fully consume the response payload, which you may want to do anyway depending
on your mileage. This would mean reading bytes from the input stream until hitting the EOS byte.
Alternatively, if you&#8217;re not interested in the server&#8217;s response, you should do as
the document above suggests and send an HTTP HEAD instead:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that in this case, neither closing the input stream nor consuming it is required
since there will be no response payload to read from.
Returning to Wireshark, here&#8217;s what the communication with the server looks like now:</p>

<p><img src="http://mttkay.github.com/images/posts/tcp_stream_keep_alive.png"></p>

<p>This is what we wanted to begin with: Client and server establish a TCP stream, then sending all
six GET requests over the same connection. After doing our work, either the client or the
server will terminate the connection by starting a FIN exchange. Here it is important to
understand that calling <code>connection.disconnent()</code> does not guarantee triggering FIN.
From the documentation of <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html">HttpURLConnection</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once the response body has been read, the HttpURLConnection should be closed by calling disconnect(). <br/>Disconnecting releases the resources held by a connection so they may be closed or reused.</p></blockquote>


<p>The emphasis here is on <em>may</em>: as you can see from the previous screenshot, it was the server
that decided to terminate the connection at some point, and not our call to <code>disconnect</code>,
since the first FIN is sent by the destination not the source.</p>

    <link href="http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2013/01/31/use-android-s-id-notation-with-care/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2013/01/31/use-android-s-id-notation-with-care</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being sloppy when it comes to managing your application&#8217;s resource IDs can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to find and debug. Imagine a scenario where foo_activity.xml holds the layout definition for FooActivity, and you define three different variants for different screen configurations:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">res/layout/foo_activity.xml<br />res/layout-land/foo_activity.xml<br />res/layout-sw600dp/foo_activity.xml</p>
<p>Now, with some certainty these three layouts will share the same views, with the same IDs, just slightly differently styled or arranged. Let&#8217;s furthermore assume in all three layouts, we have a TextView:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682037.js"></script></p>
<p>FooActivity will of course retrieve a reference to this TextView via findViewById:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682053.js"></script></p>
<p>Now what happens if in the main layout file (layout/foo_activity) you change the view&#8217;s ID? You may be surprised to hear that your application will still compile. That&#8217;s because the old view ID, my_text, still exists in R.java, since while now gone from layout/foo_activity.xml, it&#8217;s still (re)created using the @+id notation in the other two layouts, thus continuing to exist in the ID pool. Whenever these layouts are loaded and you reference the new ID from FooActivity, then of course your application will crash.</p>
<p>The problem here stems from violating the DRY principle: we&#8217;re carelessly repeating the code which creates a resource ID, when ideally, it should only ever be found in one, and only one part of the application. To recall what @+id does, it&#8217;s an idempotent &#8220;create this ID&#8221; action. In other words, if that ID has not been defined yet, it will get defined, otherwise it will be used. So it&#8217;s safe to use this notation multiple times with the same ID, which may be the reason why people overuse it: it looks like a safe bet, when it&#8217;s actually not.</p>
<p>There are three approaches I have tried to deal with this issue:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">1 - Pulling view IDs into styles</span></strong></p>
<p>When redefining views multiple times in different layouts, one approach could be to extract the respective view IDs into a style, then apply the single shared style to all three variants of the view:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682862.js"></script></p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4683025.js"></script></p>
<p>While I first favored this, there are several problems with this approach: first, it reduces the visibility of IDs, which can be confusing when dealing with views in RelativeLayout, where you reference views using IDs. Moreover, IntelliJ IDEA at least will get terribly confused and issue an error, since it doesn&#8217;t resolve styles to inspect the correctness of a layout file (it&#8217;ll assume the view is missing the ID attribute.) Lastly, and this is purely a style question, one could argue that styles should be concerned with only visual appearance, not structural attributes like IDs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">2 - Pulling view IDs into ids.xml</span></strong></p>
<p>Another option is to pull the shared view IDs into a global resource file, e.g. in res/ids.xml:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/4682090.js"></script></p>
<p>This will turn the respective view IDs into first class resources themselves, and by extension make them reachable via R.id and in all layout files. Here, too, no @+-notation is required in any layout files anymore. You would define shared IDs in one, and only one location.</p>
<p>The problems with this approach are similar to 1, but it clears up with the stylistic problem of defining IDs in a style sheet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">3 - How We Do It (TM)</span></strong></p>
<p>We ended up taking a third route, which is one of convention. We&#8217;ve agreed on establishing a rule which says that it&#8217;s fine to use @+id in layouts files, but only use it in the default layout file, i.e. the one located in res/layout. Whenever a layout is overloaded using different configuations, then even for the same views, @id should be used. That way we ensure that there is only a single location where an ID actually gets defined, without taking it completely out of context when working with layout XML. Moreover, changing the view&#8217;s ID will lead to compilation errors, since all overloaded variants now reference a non-existing ID.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to hear how everyone else deals with this.&nbsp;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big proponent of <a href="http://www.unblock-us.com/">Unblock Us</a>, a VPN-less solution for using online service that are not available in your country, such as Netflix, Hulu, Pandora etc., in your country. It&#8217;s purely based on DNS, which means it works on all network connected devices and has practically zero performance impacts.</p>
<p>One thing that always bugged was that one has to reactivate their IP address with Unblock Us whenever it changes, e.g. after rebooting your WiFi router. Previously one had to go to unblock-us.com, wait for the service checker widget to detect that you had a new IP address, and manually reactivate it by clicking a pop-up link. On Google TV this was particularly annoying, since the browsing experience isn&#8217;t exactly great and it was just uncomfortable, since you didn&#8217;t even realize until e.g. Netflix would stop working.</p>
<p>Long story short, I&#8217;ve written an Android application which does all that for you, automatically. It sits idle on your Android device and will be woken up by the system whenever your network connectivity changes. It will then automatically register with unblock-us.com with the current IP address. This should ensure a seamless viewing / listening experience for Unblock Us supported services.</p>
<p>The app is tiny, requires merely internet access permissions, and doesn&#8217;t even require a password&#8211;just your email address you used to sign up with Unblock Us. Your email address will be used to send an activation request to unblock-us.com.</p>
<p>Ideas for new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a region chooser similar to the one on the website</li>
<li>Provide a service monitor that will notify you about outages of Netflix and other services</li>

    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2012/10/18/why-the-google-tv-sdk-lacks-an-in-app-live-tv-widget</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been following Google TV for a while now, and right after its announcement I was pretty excited, pondering the vast amount of opportunities for creating Android apps that would enrich your TV viewing experience.</p>
<p>That said I was pretty dumbstruck to learn that a PIP (picture-in-picture) component, i.e. an Android view displaying the live TV stream to be embedded in your applications, does not exist (or more precisely: is not available for you to use.) In other words, the most obvious and powerful use case for an Android based TV platform, namely building Android applications around a live TV signal, is not possible to realize. Quoting from the documentation [1]:</p>
<p class="note" style="margin: 0px 0px 1.5em; padding: 6px 8px 6px 10px; border-width: 0px 0px 0px 6px; border-left-style: solid; border-left-color: #999999; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efefef;"><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The picture-in-picture (PIP) feature of the Live TV app is not available to other Android applications. Also, you can&#8217;t run an Android application in the small PIP window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As puzzling as Google&#8217;s decision to not provide such a component may sound at first, there is actually a very simple explanation for it. After last week&#8217;s DevFest event in Berlin, I had a chance to speak to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/108026429364238951323">Matt Gaunt</a>, developer advocate for Google TV in London, about this very issue. Apparently, the lack of a PIP component has purely legal reasons. Think about it: if any Android application would be able to overlay its content over a TV channel, that channel&#8217;s content could easily be compromised and the viewer tricked into believing that the overlaid content is actually part of the show. While this would not be an issue with &#8220;trusted&#8221; services such as, say, a content overlay containing background information for a news show, malicious apps could easily exploit this to misrepresent or otherwise distort the content aired by the TV channel.</p>
<p>Hence, to make this happen, Google would have to ask every single TV channel in the world for permission&nbsp;to allow content being overlaid by third party apps. You can easily see how unlikely this will ever be to happen, since Fox News is probably not interested in apps waving an Obama flag in front of their channel logo, to name one example.</p>
<p>For now, unfortunately, Google TV remains a mere TV-or-apps experience, not both.</p>

    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2012/10/15/android-s-new-build-system-good-times-guaranteed-</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of now, most of you probably heard that Google is abandoning Ant and is moving to a <a href="http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system">new, modern build system</a> based on the excellent Gradle build system. I have been a big fan of Gradle for some time now, and tried promoting and working on its Android features in my spare time (as part of <a href="https://github.com/jvoegele/gradle-android-plugin">gradle-android-plugin</a>), so this comes as fantastic news to me.</p>
<p>One thing I was worried about is that with a big change like this, the de facto standard for building, packaging and distributing Android library projects as created and promoted by the great guys behind <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/">android-maven-plugin</a>, i.e. the apklib artifact kind, would now become obsolete shortly after it had turned out so successful. Keep in mind that all work on Maven related features was and is entirely community driven, and not directly supported by Google.</p>
<p>However, android-maven-plugin&#8217;s Manfred Moser just <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!topic/maven-android-developers/lQCMRKInuyk">clarified on the developer mailing list</a> that in fact they had been working together with both Xavier Ducrohet (the Google SDK tools lead) and Hans Dockter (founder of Gradle and Gradleware&#8217;s CEO) to streamline their efforts. Here&#8217;s what will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmatic access to SDK tools functionality will be provided by an open-source library built and maintained by Google, and will be available on Maven Central</li>
<li>The former apklib artifact type will be improved upon and renamed to .aar (Android Archive), in the spirit of Java&#8217;s JAR and WAR types</li>
</ul>
<p>The Maven Android plugin will start supporting this new format in the forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>Now what does all this mean for developers? It means mostly two things: First, with Google&#8217;s move to Gradle, there will be an excellent build system available out of the box with all the neat features Gradle provides, such as exposing a nice DSL using the Groovy programming language, dependency management via Ivy, plugin support, etc. pp. Second, no one using Maven now to build their Android apps will have to make the switch: android-maven-plugin will continue to work and co-exist, and even better, it will be a symbiotic co-existence between the two systems.</p>
<p>If you want to get a 5 minute head start into Gradle for Android, have a look at my slide deck <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/matthiaskaeppler/hands-on-the-gradle">&#8220;Hands on the Gradle&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Good times guaranteed!</p>

    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2012/03/09/ignition-0-1-is-here</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today it&#8217;s &#8220;Fun Friday&#8221; (10% time)&nbsp;at Qype, so we thought this would be a good opportunity to release the first version of our <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition">ignition</a> library for Android!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ignition? In short, it&#8217;s a rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/droid-fu">Droid-Fu</a>. What is Droid-Fu? It was an attempt to create a utility library for Android that makes your life easier by creating add-ons and wrappers for the Android framework classes that are just a little friendler to use. Our approach with Droid-Fu was to pull all the helper code and boilerplate we wrote for our Qype app into a reusable library, but we did a poor job at maintaining it. We didn&#8217;t have proper release and issue management in place and since I was short of spare time (not least due to my work on <a href="http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/our-android-book-android-in-practice-is-here/">Android in Practice</a>), it just never happened. We soon&nbsp;had many issues filed, but it was virtually impossible for us to backtrack through all the snapshot versions to find out which one it was actually affecting.</p>
<p>Moreover, we did mistakes with Droid-Fu&#8217;s API design, and we wanted to have a chance of fixing these without horribly breaking all the apps that used it. Yes, we could have done a &#8220;Droid-Fu 2.0&#8221; (even though there never even was a 1.0) or a &#8220;Droid-Fu NG&#8221;, but I felt the least intrusive way would be to start out fresh as morning dew.</p>
<p>The fruit of this labor is ignition, and I believe we improved things a lot. First, here&#8217;s what ignition has to offer in the first place:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Cross-cutting stuff</span></p>
<ul>
<li>helper classes for dealing with Intents, dialogs, device screens, etc.</li>
<li>an improved version of AsyncTask (<a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-core/apidocs/com/github/ignition/core/tasks/IgnitedAsyncTask.html">IgnitedAsyncTask</a>) which makes it a lot easier to deal with the following things:    
<ul>
<li>task life-cycle: there are onStart, onComplete, onSuccess, and onError callbacks</li>
<li>yes, your task may now raise exceptions while running</li>
<li>all callbacks are guaranteed to be passed a valid Context object, so that you can immediately update the UI (those must be bound and unbound using connect/disconnect to avoid memory leaks!)</li>
<li>re-use task logic from pre- and post-execute handlers by being able to bind to different callables that execute the actual job logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-core/apidocs/com/github/ignition/core/adapters/EndlessListAdapter.html">EndlessListAdapter</a> can be used to implement lists that fetch more content when reaching the bottom of the list</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Dealing with remote images</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-core/apidocs/com/github/ignition/core/widgets/RemoteImageView.html">RemoteImageView</a> is a drop-in replacement for ImageView which can download its image resource from the Web and show a progress spinner in the mean time</li>
<li>if you&#8217;re showing a whole bunch of these, you can use <a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-core/apidocs/com/github/ignition/core/adapters/RemoteImageGalleryAdapter.html">RemoteImageGalleryAdapter</a> which will feed RemoteImageViews into an Android gallery widget</li>
<li>both are backed by <a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-support/apidocs/com/github/ignition/support/images/remote/RemoteImageLoader.html">RemoteImageLoader</a>, which can be used independently to download images drawable into ImageViews asynchronously. We use this to download thumbnail images for list elements in ListViews on the fly.</li>
<li>all this in turn is backed by <a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-support/apidocs/com/github/ignition/support/cache/ImageCache.html">ImageCache</a>, a 2-level cache which is able to cache to both internal storage and SD card, therefore minimizing network traffic when dealing with lots of data (as is the case with images)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Dealing with HTTP requests and network failures</span></p>
<ul>
<li>speaking of caching, you can not only cache image data, but also HTTP responses using <a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-support/apidocs/com/github/ignition/support/http/cache/HttpResponseCache.html">HttpResponseCache</a></li>
<li>better yet, <a href="http://mttkay.github.com/ignition-docs/ignition-support/apidocs/com/github/ignition/support/http/IgnitedHttp.html">IgnitedHttp</a> is an abstraction of Android&#8217;s Apache HttpClient that exposes a simple DSL to build and send HTTP requests, like so:    
<ul>
<li>new IgnitedHttp().get(&#8220;http://example.com&#8221;).expecting(200, 404).retries(3).withTimeout(5000).send();</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it integrates with the response cache by setting a single flag</li>
<li>it will enable GZip uncompression of response data with a single flag</li>
<li>it will register a BroadcastReceiver which listens for changes in network configuration and automatically update e.g. proxy settings for you (this can be a major source of error in your app for users who must go through carrier proxies on 3G and then fail over from or to Wi-Fi)</li>
<li>it has a more robust request-retry logic than the standard HttpClient does</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Dealing with location</span></p>
<p>Stefano has build a fantastic new way of dealing with location on Android. It takes all the cruft out of your Activities and hides it in a single annotation you drop onto an Activity. It will then automagically inject location fixes into a prepared field, using the power of AspectJ. <a href="http://mod3rn-android-coding.posterous.com/ignition-v01-ignited-way-of-doing-location">Read more about it on his blog</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">What&#8217;s different to Droid-Fu?</span></p>
<p>Except for the location module, all of this has existed in Droid-Fu. As I mentioned before, the motivation behind iginition was not to build a new library, but re-launch what worked well for us in a more maintainable and less intrusive way. Here&#8217;s what changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project is now split into multiple modules, so you can decide which ones you&#8217;d like to link. This makes the whole thing less monolithic, and for instance doesn&#8217;t force the Maps dependency on you if you do not want to use the location stuff</li>
<li>The project is less intrusive. You do not have to inherit from BetterApplication, BetterActivity or BetterService anymore (these classes have been removed). This was done as to make ignition integrate seamlessly with other libraries like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/">Roboguice</a>. We felt that ignition was not supposed to be a framework: it should be an all-opt-in solution.</li>
<li>The API has received a major cleanup. Things have been renamed, restructured, and generally made more consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where can I get more information?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition">all on GitHub</a> right now, but here are some quick links to useful stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition/wiki/Installation-and-setup">installation / usage guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition/wiki/Sample-applications">sample projects</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for everyone who contributed issue report and fixes! We promise we&#8217;ll do more regular updates with this library.</p>

    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2012/03/03/getting-to-grips-with-the-android-4-0-3-social-apis</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul>
</ul>
<p>This post also appears on&nbsp;<a href="http://engineering.qype.com/" target="_blank">engineering.qype.com</a>.</p>
<p>We recently started getting our hands onto some of the shiny new Ice Cream Sandwich APIs, particularly Beam and the <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-social-apis-in-android-ics.html">social stream API</a> that was introduced with Android 4.0.3. Integration turned out to be a little harder than we expected, mostly due to two things: code verbosity (you&#8217;ll write a lot of boilerplate) and undocumented pitfalls. With this post I&#8217;d like to shed some light on a few things that bit us when developing with the new APIs.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Integrating with the social stream</span></p>
<p>First of all, you should know that to get going with the social stream, you will have to go through two major steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publish your app as an account provider, and log in your users via the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html">AccountManager</a> API, so that contacts from your service can be synced with the Android address book (now called the People app in ICS)</li>
<li>Once your contacts are synced with the People app, import their status updates into the &#8220;Recent Updates&#8221; feed</li>
</ol>
<p>I won&#8217;t talk&nbsp;about 1. There are two excellent blog posts on how to deal with <a href="http://www.c99.org/2010/01/23/writing-an-android-sync-provider-part-1/">connecting accounts</a> and <a href="http://www.c99.org/2010/01/23/writing-an-android-sync-provider-part-2/">syncing contacts</a> respectively, plus the SampleSyncAdapter app that is shipped with the SDK ApiDemos. Once you&#8217;re there, adding support for publishing a user&#8217;s social feed is generally quite simple. From here on I assume that you have read all the documentation that is available, since I want to focus on the difficult parts. Let&#8217;s have a look at the final product first.</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:yFlmybGeCDDFFbADcDyf]]</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s quickly recap when the &#8220;Recent Updates&#8221; pane appears. It becomes available whenever there are status updates from the contact you&#8217;re looking at that are no older than a few days (I believe it&#8217;s five days, but I haven&#8217;t exactly checked that). There is also a threshold for how many items will ever show up at the same time, and as pointed out in the docs, this threshold is platform or even device specific.</p>
<p>There are two ways to import these status updates from your service: <em>eagerly</em>, as part of the contacts sync (i.e. in your contacts SyncAdapter), or <em>lazily</em>, via an Intent that is fired whenever a user looks at another user&#8217;s profile. Again, the general mechanics behind this are outlined on the <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2012/02/new-social-apis-in-android-ics.html">Android dev blog</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, you don&#8217;t want to fetch status updates (plus images) for a hundred or more contacts as part of the sync, since it&#8217;s very unlikely that a user would look at all of them to see their status updates. I say &#8220;plus images&#8221;, because you will have to download them synchronously and either insert them in binary form into the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.StreamItemPhotos.html">StreamItemPhotos</a> table, or write them to disk using an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/AssetFileDescriptor.html">AssetFileDescriptor</a>. Since ICS devices often have high resolution displays, you want to download high res images, so that&#8217;s a lot of data you&#8217;re pushing over the wire, keep that in mind.</p>
<p>Hence, you most likely want to go down the callback route, perhaps with optionally pre-populating important contacts with their status updates during contacts sync (what important means depends on your service, but you could for instance check if the user has starred a contact, and prefetch status updates accordingly).</p>
<p>Regardless for which sync strategy you settle (lazy or pre-fetched or hybrid), here are a few things that bit me while syncing social stream items.<!--more--></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Security exceptions</span></p>
<p>One thing that I kept stumbling into was security exceptions being raised even though I asked for all necessary permissions in the Android Manifest. It took me a while to figure out why that was happening, since these checks were not mentioned in the docs. Two specific situations were I encountered these were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening a single stream item in an Activity that is part of your application. You almost always want to do this, as it allows you to have a &#8220;detail view&#8221; for every type of stream item you publish.</li>
<li>Reading back photo stream items when opening the social stream. Recall that there are two different kinds of stream items: ordinary stream items, and photo stream items. Both are kept in separate tables.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ll address both points briefly now.</p>
<ol> </ol>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Resolving security exceptions for viewStreamItemActivity</span></p>
<p>The docs mention that you can register an Activity that will handle taps on a stream item to get a detailed view. This Activity is registered in contacts.xml via the viewStreamItemActivity attribute. For instance, if on our service (Qype) a user writes a review, and we then publish this action to the social stream, then clicking the stream item in the People app will open the review Activity in our app.&nbsp;However, it is undocumented how the Intent is formed that the Android People app will emit in order to launch this Activity, and as a matter of fact, if you declare this Activity without specifying a proper Intent filter, it will crash with a security exception. Without further ado, here&#8217;s the Intent filter you will have to specifiy in order for that Activity to work:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1868888.js"></script></p>
<p>You will notice that the data Uri passed as part of the Intent points to the stream item that is being viewed, so you can parse its ID conveniently using ContentUris.parseId(getIntent().getData()). Moreover, if you have a separate activity to handle photo taps/clicks in stream items (declared via&nbsp;viewStreamItemPhotoActivity), be aware that the data Uri will not point to a StreamItem, but to a StreamItemPhoto, so you will have to change the pathPattern to /stream_items/*/photos/*.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Resolving security exceptions when accessing StreamItemPhoto data</span></p>
<p>The second situation where I was encountering security exceptions was after inserting photos into the StreamItemPhoto table and reading them back when the social stream would be populated. Android complained that the account used to insert the photo records was not matching the one it then used to read them back while building the stream. To resolve this issue, one has to supply the same ACCOUNT_NAME and ACCOUNT_TYPE used to insert the respective stream item to which the photo belongs. So make sure that when inserting a photo item, you include these columns, like so:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/1868951.js"></script></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this too is not mentioned in the docs.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Watch out for those timestamps</span></p>
<p>Another thing that had me scratching my head was the stream item timestamps. First of all, I was expecting that Android would use them to not insert (or at least: not show) feed items that already exist, or that are older than the newest existing item. That is not the case; you will have to do these checks yourself if you want to avoid double insertions. This is a bit annoying, since without these checks, opening a user&#8217;s profile in the people app, then closing and re-opening it will lead to multiple insertions unless you take further action. It would have been nice to get the solution here out of the box.</p>
<p>The second and more bewildering issue is that timestamps, although used to identify the time since UNIX epoch (as one would expect), are defined in milliseconds, not seconds. Perhaps this was done so as to make it easier to work with Java&#8217;s Date.getTime, since I cannot see why one would need millisecond precision in an activity feed. The problem with using milliseconds is that it can overflow 32 bit integers, which especially on Ruby stacks will give you all sorts of trouble (like swapping over from Fixnum to BigDecimal). So keep that in mind when sending these timestamps to your server as part of the sync.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Watch out for back compat issues</span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re sharing code between your contacts sync and the social stream stuff (which is most likely the case), and if you want the contacts sync to work on pre-Honeycomb installations as well, be careful when accessing the API, since a few changes have been made since even to existing interfaces. One example where I had to put in extra checks for API compatibility was the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.GroupsColumns.html#GROUP_IS_READ_ONLY">GROUP_IS_READ_ONLY</a> column when creating a new group for Qype contacts (I suggest you always do that, since the first tab in the people app is the groups tab, and even if you only have one group this helps your data to appear more prominently), since this has been added with Honeycomb.</p>
<p>Another example is the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.DisplayPhoto.html">DisplayPhoto</a>&nbsp;table, which you can use to determine the maximum image size appropriate for the current device. Here you must resort to reflection even, since that class was added with ICS, so you must not reference it explicitly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it so far. Leave me comments if you have corrections or things to add.</p>

I initially created it to power the API connector in our <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.qype.radar">Qype Android app</a>, and kept maintaining it for a year or two, until I <a href="http://brainflush.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/stepping-back-from-signpost-development/">got bored with fixing random issues</a> with random OAuth service providers that I honestly didn&#8217;t care about whatsoever. In its latest release, the library still works flawlessly for us, so I had little motivation to continue work on it.</p>
<p>However, I understand that it probably doesn&#8217;t work flawlessly for everyone, so with me backing away from developing it further, a project maintainer was obviously needed. It looks like we&#8217;ve finally found someone who&#8217;s willing to enter the painful world of OAuth 1.0!

    <id>http://mttkay.github.com/blog/2012/01/21/robolectric-setting-android-home-for-all-tests-macos-eclipse-</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just stumbled over the somewhat annoying issue that when running <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/robolectric/">Robolectric</a> tests in Eclipse, the library must see the ANDROID_HOME environment variable, or resource lookups in the android namespace will fail (you&#8217;ll see a warning about this on the console).</p>
<p>Now, you can of course fix that by adding ANDROID_HOME to every single Eclipse Run configuration for your tests, but that would be cumbersome. It would be better to have this variable set for Eclipse so that all Java processes forked from it will inherit it, including your test runs. Unfortunately MacOS X doesn&#8217;t seem to have a straight forward solution to that. I tried modifying Eclipse&#8217;s plist file, to define <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/LaunchServicesKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009250-SW1">LSEnvironment</a>, but that did not have any effect.</p>
<p>However, what you can do is have all MacOS processes inherit it by <a href="http://www.digitaledgesw.com/node/31">setting it in /etc/launchd.conf</a>. This is somewhat quick and dirty, since you only really need it in Eclipse and Terminal, but it does the job:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>$sudo vim /etc/launchd.conf</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Now add this line:</p>
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>setenv ANDROID_HOME /path/to/android-sdk</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Reboot, and rejoice.</p>

<p>If you keep pondering the screen class of your device(s), ponder no more. I&#8217;ve built a little app that helps developers decide in which of these buckets your device falls.
